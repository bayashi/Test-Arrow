=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Arrow;

    my $arr = Test::Arrow->new;

    $arr->got(1)->ok;

    $arr->expect(uc 'foo')->to_be('FOO');

    $arr->name('Test Name')
        ->expected('FOO')
        ->got(uc 'foo')
        ->is;

    $arr->expected(6)
        ->got(2 * 3)
        ->is_num;

    $arr->expected(qr/^ab/)
        ->got('abc')
        ->like;

    $arr->warnings(sub { warn 'Bar' })->catch(qr/^Ba/);
    $arr->throw(sub { die 'Baz' })->catch(qr/^Ba/);

    done;

The function C<t> is exported as a shortcut for constructor. It initializes an instance for each.

    use Test::Arrow;

    t->got(1)->ok;

    t->expect(uc 'foo')->to_be('FOO');

    done;
